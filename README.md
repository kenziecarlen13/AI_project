A powerful OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool that converts images containing handwritten or printed text into editable digital text. Built as part of an AI class project using deep learning techniques.

## ✨ Features

- **Image to Text Conversion**: Extract text from images
- **Multiple Format Support**: Works with various image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, etc.)
- **Handwritten Text Recognition**: Capable of recognizing handwritten text
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for quick conversions
- **Offline Processing**: No internet connection required

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Executable (Recommended)

No Python installation required! Simply download and run:
