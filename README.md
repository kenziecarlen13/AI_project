# AI_Project: OCR Image to Text Converter (RIP HDD ðŸ˜­)

Welcome to **AI_Project**, a fun yet powerful OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool designed for converting images into text â€” all built as part of our AI class project!

If you're diving into this repo, make sure you have **Python** installed along with the essential libraries listed below. I'm working on making an executable version soon, so fingers crossed itâ€™ll be ready to use without any hassle! ðŸ¤ž

## Required Libraries

Before running the project, please install the following dependencies:

```python
pip install opencv-python-headless
```
```python
pip install numpy
```
```python
pip install tensorflow
```
```python
pip install keras
```
```python
pip install pillow
```

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute â€” and yes, your HDD might cry a little during training ðŸ˜…, but the results will be worth it!

If you want me to include sections like **Usage**, **Installation**, or **How It Works**, just let me know!
